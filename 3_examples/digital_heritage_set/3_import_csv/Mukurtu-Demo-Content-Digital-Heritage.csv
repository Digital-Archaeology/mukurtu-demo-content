What Plateau tribes have met up with ever since states have been made joining as the United States, is that Plateau tribes have not been considered as another government with laws that need to be considered when any kind of natural resources are to be harvested or used.  Plateau tribes have always, since treaty times, had to go to court to get counties, and states to realize that treaty rights must be a part of all considerations in the state's growth and progress in utilization of ceded lands and the natural resources. Vivian Adams, Yakama  Further Description    White people have never understood the laws Plateau people have attempted to keep; laws handed to them from the Creator, regarding use of our environment, our fellow creatures  and our natural resources.  These laws were in place and adhered to by native people  thousands of years before the white people escaped to this country seeking freedom.      Once the lands were overtaken and ""owned"" by the white people, their laws were supposed to be considered over the ancient laws of our Creator.      It was difficult for the immigrant cultures to understand the mores of the indigenous people, and these lifeways were usualy never part of the considerations to remove the Indians onto reservations or to ""civilize"" them according to the desires of the dominent culture.  White people, because they were the majority population and it was their needs and uses of the lands that became law; never understood that Plateau people have always based their societal life ways on spirituality, respect, thanks and good stewardship of all that was given to them by the Creator.  In fact, many white people didn't believe Indians had any kind of ""religion.""    The basic attitude of ""manifest destiny"" of whites moving into Plateau country is still a part of mainstream American society.  American Indians have strived to understand the whiteman's laws, and use them to be good citizens but to also protect the rights and lands left to them by hurried treaties. Vivian Adams, Yakama","This legal document is typical of the struggles Plateau tribes have met in attempting to use their treaty rights to continue traditional gathering. This is an example of resistence the Plateau people met when trying to fish in their ""usual and accustomed"" areas as stated in the 1855 Treaty signed by Plateau tribal leaders and the U.S. government (Issac Stevens, Washington Territory governor).",,,,,GIF,,,,,,,Use group defaults,,,,,Traditional Knowledge Attribution Non-Commercial (TK A-NC),http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0,Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)

Appearance was all, and one must look strong when monitoring lands stranger tribes may encroach upon. So it was necessary to have tools decorated for power but also served utilitarian purposes. Although many Plateau tribes were peaceful, there were also many who were noted for their warrior like attitudes and their great horsemanship. In early reservation times many men became upset and angry with the lies, theft and mistreatment their families and friends. Most met negative or neglegent interaction with the ""trustee"" feds and were cheated in the new cash economy by whitemen eager for Indian lands. In the history of the Plateau people there are few instances of hostile initiation by them against the whiteman; but those that did happen quickly became recorded in history as ""tragedies"" or ""massacres.""

 The geometric motifs on these items and on the tobacco bag or pipe bag, all refer to popular Plateau design elements and construction following traditional construction and decoration parameters. The cornhusk bags became smaller to be used as a handbag, used as a clothing accessory rather than a storage container; later joined by the popular beaded handbag.
  
 Hide thongs were usually used as bag handles, drawstrings on berry baskets, and as fringe decoration. Sometimes the number of design motifs (design repitition, shape, color) symbolized an event, or good luck to the maker. Shapes, patterns or central motifs representing something good is a commonly held belief among the Plateau people; just as a four-leaf clover symbolizes good luck to mainstream Americans.
  
 All artistry holds inherent spirituality: the personal touch of the maker, the prayers of thanks to the natural plants or animal skins for providing the materials, the mental and physical well-being of the maker to bring good health to the object's recipient; all contribute to the item's spiritual essense. These spiritual elements of construction are only decades old in becoming a part of artistic analysis by scholars who study Native Americans.

Even though Mr. Mann and his fellow Indian farmers tried to live by the laws made by white men for white men; they were troubled by lack of water, theft, and trustee neglegence. At every turn they were being robbed: of their water, their livestock, their lands. And yet, any complaint to the government was never resolved. Indian landowners who became farmers and ranchers had very difficult times when overcome with issues that were neglected, ignored or given advice clearly supportive of the white landowner. Mr. Mann even stated that before, under the watchful care of James H. Wilbur, times were better and the Indian better protected from government corruption and white man greed.It was difficult to understand why there was one way to treat the white man and another way to treat the Indians. Had their leaders not spoken straight words at the treaty negotiations. Didn't both the white man and the Indian agree to live on good terms with each other? Why then did the white man say one thing and do the opposite? Why were the white man's laws good for the white man but bad for the Indian? Why couldn't the white man keep his word? Were his words empty and would the future of Indian children lie in the path of continued mistreatment and lies by the Great White Father? The double standard of the government's laws when it came to justice for the Indians was birthed many years in the eastern part of these United States, and I am sorry to say, continues to this day. But Indian people are quiet and they tend to suffer quietly and attempt to mend torn words as best they can by sending their learned warriors into the white man's courts to battle for our treaty rights. How and will this double standard ever be resolved; the double standard of treatment between the government and Indian?

They fought with American military in WWI even though we had not yet been considered civilized enough to become U.S. citizens.    Many of the Plateau tribes and bands never sought wars and were relatively a peaceful culture living atonoumously in small villages led by headmen and headwomen.      The usual horse stealing, or stealing people as slaves was common among some tribes, but not so common within the Plateau people.  Guns were introduced in trade with fur trappers and later the military general stores as well as service in the early U.S. military.  Hunters began to use the weapons to kill deer, elk and other food animals but seldom used the guns against one another.    Only until it was thought that Indians were being lied to about the encroachment of the white settlers taking over their seasonal gathering grounds, keeping the lands as their own; as well as bringing in new diseases which killed off many of the village populations, did the Indians decide a violent solution was the only recourse.    Warrior societies today are proud of their military service and march proudly and many social and ceremonial tribal events.  We are all thankful for their protection of the lands we have left and our ancestors buried here.  Vivian Adams, Yakama    Protests    The American Indian Movement is most remembered by the whiteman's history.  Not all Indian people looked upon AIM's activities with favor.  Their protests did bring to the forefront the neglect, mismanagement, and injusticies heaped upon Indian people since treaty times by our ""caretakers in trust..."" injustices quickly forgoteen by mainstream America.     The short, violent Plateau conflicts called ""wars"" by whiteman's history were either misunderstandings, events of ignorance or usually just a chance to kill another Indian to get them out of the way of the whiteman's progress.    Protests for harvesting salmon, for water use, and encroachment upon sacred lands are on-going; treaty rights often neglected or ignored.   Vivian Adams, Yakama    Volunteer Malitia    Some Indians joined the U.S. Army as militia members, hunting down other tribal individuals.  Many farmers and ranchers made their own malitia supposedly dedicated to bring law breakers to justice.  Most of the time, it was just more chances to kill Indians to get them out of the way of whiteman's progress and greed for lands and the natural resources.  Vivian Adams, Yakama    U.S.-Indian Wars    The short, violent Plateau conflicts called ""wars"" by whiteman's history were either misunderstandings, events of ignorance or usually just a chance to kill another Indian to get them out of the way of the whiteman's progress.    National Wars    Indian men and women, the indigenous people of these lands called the United States, have always protected the lands upon which our ancestors used and are laid to rest; that is where our patriotism is dedicated.    They fought with American military in WWI even though we had not yet been considered civilized enough to become U.S. citizens.  Indian people still join the U.S. military services in times of need.  Everyone is familiar with the Navajo Code Talkers and how they helped win over a war with their language.  Indians have always dedicated their lives to the safety of these lands in the U.S. since assimilation.  Vivian Adams, Yakama    inter-tribal conflict    Conflict and disagreements among tribes was common.  Theft, intruding upon historical and accustomed land sites was considered trespassing.    Protection of people, usual places and resources is natural in every society and was practiced by all tribes.  There were some people who were viscious just to intimidate, but here in the Columbia River Plateau, almost all of the tribes and bands shared.    Military conflict is best remembered by the Nez Perce, the Palouse and the Cayuse people who have always been known as warriors.  Vivian Adams, Yakama",,L.V.
